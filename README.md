This is a guide for me. I often forget how to do certain things and then I need to look them up on SO again.

## Installing Brew
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Give it whatever permissions it needs. Then, via brew, install:

1. Miniforge (`brew install --cask miniforge`)
2. VIM (`brew install vim`)
3. Wget (`brew install wget`)
4.
